\title{Unpack the slope of a formula}
\usage{
unpack_slope(form, i, ttype, last_slope)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{A formula}

\item{i}{Segment number (integer)}

\item{ttype}{The term type. One of "ct" (central tendency), "sigma" (variance),
or "ar" (autoregressive)}

\item{last_slope}{The element in the slope column for this ttype in the previous
segment. I.e., probably what this function returned last time it was called!}
}
\value{
A "one-row" list with code (char) and a tibble of slopes.
